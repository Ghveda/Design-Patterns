TypeScript Design Patterns And SOLID Principles

OOP
Abstraction, Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism

Abstraction

- Represent real-world entities as objects
- Hide complexity and focus on essential features

Encapsulation

- Bundle data and operations in class
- Restrict access to internal data

Inheritance

- Create new classes from existing ones
- Promote code reusability and modularity

Polymorphism

- Single interface for different object types
- Enable code to work with different data types
